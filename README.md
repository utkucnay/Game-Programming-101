# Procedural Level Generation
I create level random procedural level generation.

# Procedural Render

- I created Perlin noise and used a fractal algorithm on it.
- I spawn objects in specific range.
- I coded denisty and distance for each object.

# Procedural Placement

- I use texture realite location and I spawn objects in middle pixel.
