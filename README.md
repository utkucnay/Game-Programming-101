# Game-Programming-101
I learn Game Programming and use them for this project.

I use Unreal Engine for this project.

I am coding all techniques for CPU. I will learn compile shader after finish this project. I watched GDC videos and Companies firstly coded on CPU so It's good start point for game programming.
