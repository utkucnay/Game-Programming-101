# Game-Programming-101
I am learning game programming and using Unreal Engine for my project.

I am coding all techniques for the CPU. After I finish this project, I will learn how to compile shaders. I watched GDC videos and learned that many companies first code on the CPU, so it's a good starting point for game programming.

# Procedural Render With Perlin Noise

- I created Perlin noise and used a fractal algorithm on it.
- I spawn objects in specific range.
- I coded denisty and distance for each object.

# AI and Pathfinding

- I will code data oriented HFSM(Ref1).  
- I will code grid based a star pathfinding.
