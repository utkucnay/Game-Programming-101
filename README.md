# Procedural Level Generation
I created level random procedural level generation.

# Procedural Render

- I created texture with Perlin noise.
- I used a fractal algorithm on it.

# Procedural Placement

- I spawned objects in middle pixel of texture.
- I coded denisty and distance for each object.
